  <h1>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h1>
  <p>This is the first paragraph of our test chapter. It contains <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em>.</p>
  <p>Here's another paragraph with more content to test word counting and reading time estimation.</p>
  
  <h1>Chapter 2: The Journey</h1>
  <p>The second chapter begins here. We'll test multiple chapters in a single document.</p>
  <p>This chapter has different content to ensure our chapter splitting logic works correctly.</p>
  
  <h1>Chapter 3: The Conclusion</h1>
  <p>The final chapter of our test document. This will help us verify that all chapters are imported correctly.</p>
  <p>We can also test special characters: "quotes", 'apostrophes', and â€” dashes.</p>
